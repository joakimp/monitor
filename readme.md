# A monitoring system

This is a monitoring solution based on docker, [grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor), and [prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus). See [this](https://brooks.sh/2018/06/03/monitoring-your-home-lab-with-grafana-in-docker/) link for details.

All this is set up as a stack using docker-compose.yaml
